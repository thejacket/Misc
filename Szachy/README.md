Chess

2 CPUS playing chess versus each other, can choose between two CPU-strategies:
- Losowy(Random) - will choose any legal move randomly
- Drapie¿ny(Aggresive) - will choose randomly a capturing move, if not possibly behaves like Losowy.

TODO: employ tests to prove that Aggresive has overwhelmingly higher win ratio.
